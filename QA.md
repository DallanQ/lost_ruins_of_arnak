[playing-a-card-to-overcome-a-guardian](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2732132/playing-a-card-to-overcome-a-guardian)

> When you need a travel icon to overcome a guardian can you play a card to use the travel icon? Because the rules say you can only do one main action, but if you do this it would be two main actions because you are playing a card and overcoming a guardian. The other option would be to use a travel icon on an assistant which would not be using two main actions.

Yes, you can use cards for travel icons to overcome a guardian. Paying a travel icon is not a main action in itself, you can use them to dig at a site, discover a new site or overcome a guardian (which are all main actions). You DO explicitly "play" a card for its travel icon, and doing so is not a main action. The rules are explicitly clear that you can "play" a card for its travel icon, or for its effect. If the effect does not have a lightning icon, then playing the card for its effect is a main action (and you must do exactly one main action per turn).

See page 8: "You can play a card either for its travel icon or its effect but not both."

[idol](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3194220/idol)

> Can an idol still be used in a slot even when the idol's effect has not been used, i.e. a face up idol? For example, a player in one of our games had an idol who's effect was to flip over a guardian and re-use its boon. However, the guardian hadn't even been used, but an idol slot was still required.

When you claim an idol, you must either use its effect immediately or forfeit it. The idol is then flipped over when taken to show the effect is no longer available. According to the rulebook, when you gain an idol, if you can't use the effect at that moment, the effect is lost, but you keep the idol face down. You can never have face-up idols on your player board.

[archaelogist-placement](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2621084/archaelogist-placement)

> Once you place an archaeologist (either to dig or to discover), they are permanently locked in that place until end of round (barring special cards that let you move them), correct?

You are correct and the rule book is clear: unless by some card effect, your workers stay on the board until the end of the round. This contributes to the tight resource and action management of the game.

[bonus-tiles-from-research](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3026493/bonus-tiles-from-research)

> If I get a bonus tile that allows me to turn, for example, a tablet into a spear but I don’t have a tablet at the moment, do I lose the tile or can I keep it and use it later in the game?

You are not able to save it for another turn, but the rulebook says "you are allowed to resolve the row’s effect before using the bonus tile, if you want." If you do not want to or cannot use it, you forfeit the bonus.

[question-about-using-assistants](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2629526/question-about-using-assistants)

> When using an assistant's ability to say get any resource token, does it have to be used immediately (spent), or can you collect a resource and place it in your inventory? For instance, can you collect a resource from an assistant's ability, then change him to his gold side, reset him, use the ability again, and collect more resources, then pass and use all the resources on a later turn?

Resources gained from assistants are added to your supply; they do not need to be spent on the turn they are gained. However, note that if you "pass," that means you cannot take any more turns for that round. Most of the assistants are quick actions, meaning you still need to take a full action (using a card's action, sending a worker to a dig site, Pass, etc.) as part of your turn.

> I bought the Ostrich item card and was wondering if you have to be able to complete the full action of the card in order to play the card as a main action? (I.E. play the ostrich card and draw a card from my deck but I don’t have an assistant in my ready area to play on a dig site or discover a site, can I just play the card to draw a card?)

Those actions on the Ostrich say you "may" do them. Archeologists are not Assistants. Ostrich has nothing to do with assistants. You always evaluate effects in the order they are printed (keep in mind that some effects are optional and can be skipped, this is the case with Sturdy Boots, Sea Turtle, Ostrich, etc. where you can evaluate only part of the effect).

[only-1-main-action-per-round](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2979928/only-1-main-action-per-round)

> I noticed that you get only 1 Main Action/round. So this means in 1 round you get to either, play a card, buy a card, discover, dig, research, overcome a guardian and pass. Doesn't this feel very limiting? Since there are only 5 rounds, how do you achieve a lot of research, build a good deck, defeat guardians for points, etc ?

It's one main action per turn - take as many turns in a round as you can. Players keep taking turns until everyone has passed, and then the round ends. This means you can have multiple actions in a round, and by creating combos of actions, you can take many turns, especially in the later rounds.

[sites-with-slashes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2963006/sites-with-slashes)

> Any time you see a slash symbol it means you get to choose one or the other resource, correct ?

Every time you see a slash, it means 'one or the other.' The rulebook clearly says 'choose'. In this context, the slash indicates a choice between options, not 'per'.

[can-you-use-a-research-assistant-between-the-row-e](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3113231/can-you-use-a-research-assistant-between-the-row-e)

> Can you resolve a row effect and then use a research assistant before resolving the bonus tile in the research track?

Yes, you can. The rules state that free actions may be used during a main action. Although the row effect and bonuses are resolved 'immediately,' the term 'during' implies that actions can be taken between these resolutions. Therefore, you can draw a card from the row effect, discard it to use your research assistant to gain an arrowhead, and then upgrade that arrowhead to a gem. The intent behind 'immediately' likely means you can't bank effects for later, not that you can't take quick actions in between.

[gaining-fear-from-guardian](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2548646/gaining-fear-from-guardian)

> One of the cards gives you the option to move your archeologist from one site to another site. Do you gain fear if you remove it from a site with a Guardian?

No, you do not gain a *Fear* card in this situation. As you rightly note, gaining a *Fear* card from guardians is only checked at the end of round when you take your archaeologist back from a site that has a guardian on it. According to the rules, to avoid this, you may try to overcome the guardian as an action on a later turn. Or you might be able to escape the guardian with the help of certain cards that allow you to move your archaeologist or the guardian.

> Can I hire a pilot for 2 coins and use it to defeat a guardian, or is the pilot only useful for traveling?

Yes, you can use the pilot to defeat guardians. The plane or pilot can be used anywhere you would normally use a travel symbol, including to defeat guardians.

> Say I played the card on my turn. Does its effect affect the whole turn including subsequent rounds or only the round it has been played just as a "flash" effect?

It's a single immediate (and free) action when you purchase it. To reuse it, you must draw the card from your deck again and on those subsequent occasions pay a tablet to gain the benefit of the card.

> If a Guardian requires me to spend a Boot icon, can I still spend a Boat or a Car, or even a Plane? Or pay two coins to replace the icon to begin with, using the travel hierarchy?
Or in the case of the Giant Ant guardian, I must spend Boots specifically?

Yes. You can always sub the other travel icons for boots, including for guardians (and of course planes for cars/boats as well).

[general-queries](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2612454/general-queries)

>  If the assistants effect is used for its travel value to place a worker, does this count as a main action even if that assistant is an extra (lightning symbol) action? If not then in theory you could move two workers to two different sites on one turn.

Yes, the icon generation is a free action; the worker placement is not. Think of travel icons as resources. Generating them is a free action since any unused travel resources are always lost at the end of your turn, but worker placement itself is a main action.

> The Aeroplane's card 'effect' allows the player to move to a site with a reduction of one aeroplane travel value. Does this mean that when played you can still play another card for its travel value in order to place a worker on a site, effectively using two main actions?

Yes, you can use an additional travel icon if needed to meet the cost. The rulebook (page 24) states: “The effects below allow you to perform an action. Normally it would be the main action of your turn, but here it is considered simply part of the effect. You may immediately take a Dig at a Site or Discover a New Site action, if you have an archaeologist on your player board. The effect may specify special benefits or limitations."

> Passing is considered a main action, but some cards let you gain benefits (like Compasses) when you pass. Does this mean you’re using two main actions on one turn?

No, this is treated as a single combined action. The rulebook states, “pass to gain: To gain the benefit, you must pass. You will get no more turns for the remainder of the round.” This means that using the card’s effect to gain Compasses when you pass does not allow you to take any further actions for the rest of the round; the turn ends immediately after using the card.

[hidden-totems](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2577312/hidden-totems)

> If i discover a place where i get an open and an hidden totem, do i get the effects of both or only for the open one?

You only get the effect of the open totem. According to the rulebook (page 10), when discovering a new site with two totems, “take them both, but use only the effect of the face-up one.” You still gain endgame points for both totems, but only the open one provides an immediate effect.

[solo-dig-at-site-look-for-any-site-offering-the-re](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3049980/solo-dig-at-site-look-for-any-site-offering-the-re)

> In solo play, if a site tile shows multiple resources, including the resource the rival wants to dig for (as shown on its action tile), does the rival go to that site even if other resources are present?

Yes, the rival will go to a site as long as it offers the desired resource, even if other resources are also present. If there are multiple dig sites that offer what the rival wants, then...

The rulebook says:
"If there are multiple such spaces, your rival chooses one with the following priorities:
 - A site in a higher row is preferred over a site in a lower row.
 - Between sites in the same row, your rival prefers the site farther
on the left or the right, as determined by the decision arrow"

If the multiple sites are on the same row, then use the arrow on the Rival action stack and choose the site that is the farthest in that direction.

And if the action stack is empty, you use the tile on the bottom of the used action tile stack.

[guardians-crown-artifact-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3027659/guardians-crown-artifact-card)

> When using the Guardian's Crown artifact card, if a guardian is moved to a tent (camping) site, does it stay there until someone removes it? Can guardians normally be placed on tent sites?

Yes, the guardian stays on the tent site until it is removed by a player, following the standard rules for guardians. While guardians typically do not appear on tent sites (since they are usually placed when new sites are discovered, which are not tent sites), the Guardian’s Crown artifact card is an exception that explicitly allows a guardian to be placed on a tent site.

[using-an-artifact-for-its-travel-icon-on-purchase](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2569690/using-an-artifact-for-its-travel-icon-on-purchase)

> Can you use an artifact's travel icon immediately after buying it instead of its effect?

No, when you buy an artifact, you have the option to immediately resolve only its effect, ignoring the usual cost (tablet cost) for this initial play. According to the rulebook on page 8, "You can play a card either for its travel value or its effect but not both." After purchasing, the artifact's effect (bottom half) is the only option available for immediate use, as clarified on page 12 which states that "When you buy an artifact, you get to resolve its effect. That effect might be another action, like sending an archaeologist to dig at a site. All this is considered to be part of your main action for the turn." Therefore, the travel icon (top left corner) cannot be used when an artifact is initially acquired.

[what-do-gold-on-coconut-flask-artifact-represent](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2929477/what-do-gold-on-coconut-flask-artifact-represent)

> What do the gold coins on the Coconut Flask artifact represent?

The gold coins on the Coconut Flask artifact indicate that you earn two gold after activating the card, not that you need to pay them. This is confirmed by the rules and iconography used in the game. Unlike other cards that explicitly indicate a cost with a brown triangle, the Coconut Flask does not have such a symbol, meaning the coins are a reward rather than a payment.

[2-newbie-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2664109/2-newbie-questions)

> When placing a worker on camp sites, do you also place a guardian? Or is the guardian only for when discovering level 1 and 2 sites for the first time?

No, you do not place a guardian on camp sites. Guardians only appear when a player discovers a new site (level 1 or 2) for the first time. They remain on the board until they are overcome but do not affect the placement of workers at camp sites.

> What are the reserve tiles used for?

According to the rulebook in page 23, Reserve tiles serve two main purposes:
1. The ×3 multiplier tiles are intended for use if you 
are close to running out of tokens. Each token on 
the tile counts as 3. Tokens on the supply board are 
not intended to be limited.
2. The other side of the tile is a *fear* tile. If you are 
supposed to take a *Fear* card when the *Fear* deck is 
empty, you take a *fear* tile instead. It will be worth 
-2 points during final scoring. Keep the *fear* tile in 
your play area. If you have a chance to exile a card 
from your play area, you may exile the *fear* tile 
instead.

In playtesting, we needed these tiles only in extremely 
rare situations. Depending on your play style, your 
group might never need them

[using-an-artifact-card-for-its-travel-icons-pay-a](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2668433/using-an-artifact-card-for-its-travel-icons-pay-a)

> If you use an artifact from your hand for its travel icons, do you still pay a tablet? Or is the tablet payment ONLY if you use the card's ability?

You do not pay a tablet when using an artifact card for its travel icons. The tablet payment is required only when you use the card’s main ability. According to the rules on page 9, you pay travel costs by "spending" a card with appropriate travel symbols. Spending a card for travel symbols is not the same as "playing" a card (page 13).

Therefore, you can use the artifact's travel icons without any additional cost.

This distinction allows players to utilize early artifacts effectively for movement, even if they do not have tablets available to activate the card's ability.

[is-it-always-free-to-spend-the-travel-value-of-a-c](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3159569/is-it-always-free-to-spend-the-travel-value-of-a-c)

>  Is it always "free" to spend the travel value of a card?
> What does "Play a Card" mean? What does "Resolve the card's effect" mean on the rules page? Is it always the symbol or text under the picture, and never the travel icon side?

Yes, it is considered "free" to use the travel value of a card

"Playing" a card for the travel icon isn't an action at all. You just put the card in your play area to pay a cost. If you want to use that specific assistant, you pay the cost (a boot) to gain an arrowhead.
This "buying" an arrowhead at the cost of a boot travel token is a free action, because the assistant shows a lighting bolt.

If you play the card for its effect (by putting it in your play area), you ignore the travel icon(s) at the top and resolve the shown action.

According to the rulebook in page 13:

"Play a Card" involves taking a card from your hand and placing it face up into your play area (unless you get a chance to exile it). This action is distinct from using a card for its travel symbols.

[binoculars-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2638498/binoculars-card)

> The Binoculars card allows you to activate any Level 1 site. If you have this card can you activate a Level 1 site to reveal a guardian? If so, is that guardian your responsibility to defeat or receive a fear card?

The Binoculars card allows you to activate any Level 1 site without placing an archaeologist there, meaning you do not interact with or reveal a guardian at that site. Activating means using the benefits of a site tile that is already on the board. You don't need to place an archaeologist there.

Visiting an existing site doesn’t reveal a new guardian. Guardians only give a *fear* card at the end of a round when you retrieve your explorer from a site with a guardian.

According to the rulebook, page 24: "When you activate a site, you use the site’s effect. You do not need an archaeologist there and other players’ archaeologists do not block you from activating the site." Therefore, using the Binoculars card does not involve defeating a guardian or receiving a *fear* card since you are only activating an already discovered site.

> Flask allows you to draw 3 cards when exiled. Do you have to play & consume the card (removing this card form your hand) to activate this ability. Or can you exile the card using another effect (ie use the ship part of Flask to use a work placement action then exile it to get the 3 card draw)?

It is not a passive effect that happens whenever the card is exiled. It is a part of the cost when you play the card, that you must also exile the card. If the card is not played from your hand for its effect, but you use it for travel icons instead, then nothing that is written on the card matters, it will not take effect.

As stated in the rulebook, page 8: "You can play a card either for its travel value or for its effect but not both." Therefore, to get the card draw benefit, you must play the Flask from your hand.

[solo-discover-ii-when-all-iis-are-discovered](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3029273/solo-discover-ii-when-all-iis-are-discovered)

> What happens when rival does "Discover a Level II site" but all Level II's are already discovered? Does he discover a Level I site instead, or do nothing?

If the rival is supposed to discover a level II site, but all level II's are already discovered, then it's clearly impossible to discover a level II site, and so the rival does nothing.

According to the rulebook, page 20: "If the situation makes the action impossible, your rival does nothing on that turn." There is no indication in the rules that allows for a downgrade to discovering a Level I site in this scenario. The action is strictly tied to whether Level I or Level II sites are available based on the round.

[quick-question-on-solo-ai](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2983485/quick-question-on-solo-ai)

> When they draw the action tile where they acquire move up on the research track and gain an assistant, if they already have more than 2 (not that they even use the assistants), do they keep discarding the assistants from the supply pile?

The Rival doesn't slot assistants on their board, so I don't believe there is a capacity rule for the Rival. The assistants are removed from the game whenever they take one from a stack, so they continue to do so every time they draw that tile. No assistant is safe!

"Take the topmost assistant from the highest stack on the supply board. If stacks are tied, use the decision arrow. Remove the assistant from the game"

> If I draw two fear cards and end up with one as my last card in play area and have already moved my explorers, do I have to just keep it until the next turn or can I use it to move one of my explorers a second time?

You cannot use a *fear* card to move an archaeologist a second time. They stay put once placed, unless a card action lets you relocate them. You use the main action "Pass", put the card in your play area or not by carrying it over, and deal with it at end of round cleanup.

According to the rulebook, page 17, it states that "Usually your hand will be empty. But if you have cards left, each card can be discarded to your play area or saved for the next round."

[how-do-blocking-tiles-and-the-small-tent-symbol-wo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2867008/how-do-blocking-tiles-and-the-small-tent-symbol-wo)

> In the manual, for a 3 person game, there are only 3 blocked sites on the board, but in the text they show 3 symbols and 2 blocked tiles. Each of those “block” tiles has a resource on the opposite side. When are those awarded?
> If the “double boot” is blocked, I understand you can’t put a worker there. But if it’s a symbol does this become an additional benefit when someone takes the “single boot” action?
> what about the small tent symbol in each of those sites? If a card says to activate one or more of those sites do you get all the benefits at all player counts? Ina 2 player game ALL the double boots are blocked. So can you activate that “tent” to gain the effect from the site again?

Those icons are literally used to randomize which spaces get the blocking token. If you draw the coin, compass, and arrowhead blocking tiles, that’s where you put them. They serve no other function.

Any card that activates a tent space only activates once. Dog for example: activate an unoccupied tent space. If you choose compasses, you’ll get two compasses whether or not there’s a blocking token there. One artifact (passage shell) lets you activate a tent space twice, but that’s the only exception. And my point is that the boot symbols and blocking tiles are irrelevant when activating these spaces.

> If a site has an Archeologist present and an empty slot, can you play dog there?

If a site has an archeologist, then it is clearly not "an unoccupied site", which by definition according to the rulebook in page 24 states that "A site is unoccupied if no one has an archaeologist figure there. (Guardian tiles do not count as occupying a site.) An occupied site might still have an unoccupied space even though the site is considered “occupied”".

[clarification-for-artifact-card-monkey-medallion](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611225/clarification-for-artifact-card-monkey-medallion)

> The card says "Gain an item and place it on the top of your deck." Where do I get the item from? Do I take one from the available items in the row, do I draw a random one from the deck or am I missing something else I should do?

According to the rulebook, page 24, states that "When you gain an item, it means you do not pay the cost. Unless otherwise stated, this is identical to the Buy a Card action, except you skip the step in which the cost is paid." So you take it from the card row (available items), not from the deck. Now you are sure which card you'll draw next round, or when you play an appropriate card to take the just gained item. If you could draw from the deck, you'll (almost) never know what item you get.

> I visited a site and got free card, coin and tablet. I didn't overcome Guardian and visited another site. I came back to original site. Do I get card/coin/tablet again?

Yes, you do get the site effects again when you revisit a site, as long as you pay the travel costs and the site is unoccupied (no other figures are present). Each time you transport your worker to an available site, you will receive all the rewards on the tile.

If you have an archaeologist at a site and then move to another site, your archaeologist remains there until the end of the round unless moved by an effect of an item or artifact. If there is a Guardian at the site when you take your worker back, you will receive 1 *fear* card.

> Do you only get one turn per round? Or as many as you need before you can't do anything more?

The rulebook in page 7 describing the game overview states that, "The game is played over 5 rounds."

"Players take turns choosing various actions that help them uncover the secrets of the island. Over the course of the game, more of the island will be explored and more actions will become available. Actions can earn you resources, opportunities, and points."

"Each round proceeds as follows:

1. Draw. All players draw from their decks until they have a hand of 5 cards.

2. Take turns. The player with the starting player marker starts. Players take turns clockwise around the table. You are limited to one main action on your turn, plus an unlimited number of free actions.

3. Pass. On your turn, you may pass to indicate you are done playing for the remainder of the round. The other players continue taking turns until all players have passed."

> I played a brown card (equipment) which allowed me to immediately buy a blue card (artifact) with a discount of 3 compasses. While doing that, I had the silver "discount assistant" active on my player board. Was I allowed to tap my assistant to get an additional discount of a 4th compass ?

The discount assistant does not allow for cumulative discounts. The assistant must be used as your main action, which prevents you from using other main actions in the same turn. The rulebook specifies: "To use your assistant, turn it sideways, as shown. A sideways assistant is exhausted and not available for use" (Page 16).

The discount assistant does not count as a free action because it lacks the lightning bolt symbol. Therefore, it cannot be combined with other card effects that grant discounts. The rulebook further clarifies: "If you buy a card from the card row when using this assistant, then the use of this assistant is your main action, and the assistant must be turned sideways" (Page 16).

> If I play a card with the "draw a card" symbol and I have no face down cards left in my draw pile, do I shuffle the cards I have played this round and draw from them, or do I just forfeit the benefit?

You gain no benefit if the card deck is empty. The rulebook clarifies in page 24, that "You may draw a card. If your deck is empty, then this has no effect".

The rulebook further clarifies that “Shuffled cards go to the bottom of your deck. And only at the end of the round – you shouldn’t be shuffling cards at any other time.”

> When an Item or Artifact card states "Exile this card to gain X," do I need to use an exile action from another source, or can I simply exile it directly when playing the card?

You can exile the card directly as part of playing it to gain the specified benefit. The rules clarify that when you play a card with the "exile this card to..." ability, the exile happens as part of that action. You do not need to use a separate exile action from an idol, bonus, or assistant. The rulebook states: "Exile this card to: When you play the card for its effect, it goes to exile instead of your play area." (Page 24, Keywords)

This means that the card performs its own exile when you trigger its effect, allowing you to immediately gain the reward without needing any additional actions.

As specified in the rulebook:

[exile](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2555281/exile)

> Certain item cards allow you to exile it to gain an effect. Do you need to do something which gives an exile symbol to gain this effect or does playing the card by itself give you the ability to exile it?

You do not need to use an exile action from another source. When you play a card that has the text "Exile this card to gain X," simply playing the card allows you to exile it for its effect as part of that action.

However, if you choose to use the card for its travel icon and later exile it using another exile action, you will not gain the effect. You can only trigger the effect when you play the card as your main action, at which point you can choose to exile it for the stated benefit.

[which-sites-a-dog-can-reach](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035653/which-sites-a-dog-can-reach)

> Some cards show a tent symbol (A) and not the level one sites symbol [ | ] or the level two sites symbol [ ( ) ]. Does it mean that I can send the Dog to fetch things only from the base level sites (with an actual tent symbol)?

Yes, the Dog can only fetch from an unoccupied base camp site, which is indicated by the tent symbol. You can send the Dog to fetch resources from an empty tent site, which allows you to gain one of the following: 2 coins, 2 compasses, 2 tablets, 1 arrowhead, or (by putting one of your hand cards into your play area) 1 jewel.

An "unoccupied" site is defined as one where no one has an archaeologist figure present. Guardian tiles do not count as occupying a site, so even if a site has unoccupied spaces, it is still considered occupied if an archaeologist is there.

[can-you-play-a-free-action-without-playing-a-main](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3124362/can-you-play-a-free-action-without-playing-a-main)

> Can you play a free action without playing a main action?

No. You must do a main action. However, passing is a main action. This means you can perform free actions and then PASS as your main action, which finishes your turn for the round The rulebook confirms this:

"If you take no other main action, then you must pass. It is not legal to take a turn with only free actions and no main action" (Page 17, under Passing).

Additionally, the rules state on Page 8:

"Choose one of these actions as the main action for your turn: Dig at a Site, Discover a New Site, Overcome a Guardian, Buy a Card, Play a Card, Research, Pass."

*Pass* is explicitly listed as a main action, and the rules for free actions indicate they can be played at any time during a turn, regardless of the chosen main action.

> Do research markers work only directly upwards? E.g. if you go left path, do you have to stick to left path with either the magnifying glass or the notebook?

Yes, you always have to move upwards to a connecting box, so you can’t go to the side. According to the rulebook: “A research action moves one of your research tokens up to the next row of the research track.” Additionally, “You can only move up into a space that is connected to your current space. Sometimes this leaves you with only one choice.” It's important to note that you can only move your marker to connected spaces, which means that moving across an empty gap is not allowed.

You can overpay for a travel cost icon. As mentioned in the rules, it is possible to pay with different icons in the same way as travel costs. The hierarchy chart of travel cost icons indicates that an airplane covers any icon, and a boat or a car can cover a boot icon. Just remember, you cannot pay for a car with a boat, or vice versa.

[guardians-crown-getting-token](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2759106/guardians-crown-getting-token)

> The card "Guardian's Crown" allows you to "Move a guardian from a site you occupy to an unoccupied tent or level 1 site with no guardian. Activate that site." Does this mean that when you activate the site, it functions similarly to placing an archaeologist? This seems quite powerful to me

It's not "too powerful" - it costs 4 compasses to buy the card for starters. And yes, you move the guardian to an unoccupied site as described and activate it. "Activate a site" and "unoccupied site" are both defined on the back of the rulebook:

"**activate a site**: When you activate a site, you use the site’s effect. You do not need an archaeologist there and other players’ archaeologists do not block you from activating the site, unless the card says otherwise. You do not pay any travel cost. You cannot activate a site that has not been discovered yet."

"**unoccupied site**: A site is unoccupied if no one has an archaeologist figure there. (Guardian tiles do not count as occupying a site.) An occupied (Tent) site might still have an unoccupied space even though the site is considered “occupied”."

So no, you don't get an idol because you cannot activate a site that has not been discovered yet. You just get the tokens shown on the destination site's tile.

You must use the artifact's effect immediately when you acquire it. The rulebook on page 12, "Buy a card", state that you "have the option to immediately resolve its effect." If you want to wait to use it, you'll need to wait to buy it, but that could risk someone else purchasing it first.

Once you are in the temple you can buy any tile you like. You must be at the top of the research track to buy temple tiles, and you can purchase as many tiles of the same kind as you like during the game, but only one tile per action. (Rulebook, page 14: "If you choose to research with your magnifying glass when it is already in the Lost Temple, instead of paying to advance the token, you pay to take 1 temple tile from any one of the stacks.")

> Does 'available on the supply board' mean the assistant on the top of the stacks only?

Yes, 'available on the supply board' refers to the assistants on the top of the stacks. As stated on page 15 of the rules, Recruiting Assistants:

"When you move your notebook to a row with this symbol, choose one of the assistants available on the supply board. (Usually, there are 3; however, some of the stacks might be empty later in the game.)"

"Note: Assistants not on top are supposed to be kept hidden so that no one knows what they are until the assistant above them has been taken."

"Set the assistant on one of the assistant squares on your player board. The silver side should be face up.
Assistants have various effects. If the effect is a free action, you have the option to use it immediately, or you can save it for later."

Thus when recruiting assistants, you can choose one of the assistants available on the supply board, which usually means the top three assistants.

[dig-at-a-site-rule](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2655811/dig-at-a-site-rule)

> Is it allowed to dig at a site where my archaeologist is already located on a subsequent turn?

No, it is not allowed. According to the rulebook on page 9, to dig at a site, you must move your archaeologist to that space, which requires that the space be unoccupied. Since your archaeologist is already at the site, you cannot activate it again for additional rewards.

Rulebook, page 9:

To Dig at a Site
1. Pay the travel cost depicted on the space to which you want to send your archaeologist. The space must be unoccupied. (That is, it must have no archaeologist figure on it, and in a 2- or 3-player game, it must have no blocking tile.)
2. Move your archaeologist from your player board to that space.
3. Resolve the effect depicted at the site.

No, you cannot travel further with your archaeologists after placing them on the board during the same round. According to the rules, when you place an archaeologist on the board, they remain at that location for the round. You can only move an archaeologist from your player board to an unoccupied site, unless you have a card that allows for additional movement.

> When the rival wants to gather resources like rubies, money, or tablets, how do you choose the location?

As stated in the rulebook: "A site in a higher row is preferred over a site in a lower row. Between sites in the same row, your rival prefers the site farther on the left or the right, as determined by the decision arrow."

So, if no sites in the second level are discovered yet or available, the rival will go to the first level and choose either left or right.

Cards drawn and cards played are two separate things. As stated in the rulebook on page 7, 

Rulebook, page 7:

"Each round proceeds as follows:

1. Draw. All players draw from their decks until they have a hand of 5 cards."

Unless a game's rules specifically state otherwise, a 'hand' is private information for the player concerned". Therefore, the cards you draw from your deck and hold in your hand are not public info; only you can see them. However, when you play a card, it becomes visible. As clarified on page 13:

Rulebook, page 13:

To Play a Card

"1. Play the card from your hand face up into your play area."

[how-many-turns-can-you-take-per-roundjust-two](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2627899/how-many-turns-can-you-take-per-roundjust-two)

> How many turns can you take per round... just two? I am assuming just 2 since you have two meeples, although, I guess there are other things to do that do not require meeples to be assigned to a spot?

While you have two meeples, your turns are not limited to just two actions. You can take one main action per turn, plus an unlimited number of free actions. As noted in the rulebook, 

"2. Take turns. The player with the starting player marker starts. Players take turns clockwise around the table. You are limited to one main action on your turn, plus an unlimited number of free actions." 

"3. Pass. On your turn, you may pass to indicate you are done playing for the remainder of the Round. The other players continue taking turns until all players have passed." (page 7).

The rulebook lists various main actions, including Dig at a Site, Discover a New Site, Overcome a Guardian, Buy a Card, Play a Card, Research, and Pass (page 8). This means that, depending on your resources, you can perform multiple actions in a round by chaining these actions together.

Passing is specifically a Main Action. When a player Passes, they can take no more turns in that round. When everyone passes, the Round ends. Page 17 elaborates on this:

"On your turn, you can choose to pass – inform the other players that you will take no more turns this round. Passing counts as your main action for the turn. At this time, you should also use up any free actions you still have available.

If you take no other main action, then you must pass. It is not legal to take a turn with only free actions and no main action.

Once you have passed, you get no more turns for the rest of the round. The flow of play continues clockwise, but it skips over you. Conversely, if you are the only player left who has not yet passed, then you can take multiple turns in a row.

The round ends when all players have passed." (Rulebook page 17)

If you're unable to take any other Main Action, you must Pass, which counts as your main action for that turn. You can choose to Pass at any point as a Main Action, though doing so means you won’t take any further turns in that round (which may not always be ideal). Play continues with each player taking their turn in sequence until everyone has passed, at which point the round ends. So, depending on your strategy and resources, you can potentially take many turns within a round.

[fear-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3102743/fear-card)

> Can I use one of my "fear" cards to "use up a card" to get a jewel at the lower rightmost dig site?

Yes, you can use *fear* cards as discards. According to the rulebook, on page 8, it states, "A *Fear* card has no effect. It can however be used for its travel value." Additionally, on page 24, it mentions, "You pay this cost by putting one of the cards in your hand face up into your play area, ignoring the card’s travel value and effect." This means you can discard a *fear* card to fulfill a requirement without using its boot value. Just keep in mind that while *fear* cards can be useful in this way, they do not contribute positively to your victory points.

[assistent](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2559231/assistent)

> If I already have two assistants, is it possible to take a third?

No, you cannot take a third assistant. According to the rulebook, you are allowed to take only two silver assistants from the research track and then upgrade them to gold assistants as you progress. There is no game mechanic that allows you to gain a third assistant, and the only related card allows you to exchange one of your existing assistants.

[airdrop-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2566844/airdrop-card)

> How do you use the Airdrop card? Do you take an item card from the play area, from the deck, or do you take one from the display for free?

When you use the Airdrop card, you exile it (place it at the top of the game board) to gain an item from the card row for free. Unlike most gained items that go to the bottom of your draw deck, the item you gain with Airdrop goes directly to your hand. So, to clarify, you take the item from the display.

[final-scoring-and-leftover-tokens](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2580234/final-scoring-and-leftover-tokens)

> At the end of the game, is there any scoring for leftover tokens? For example, if I end with two parchments and two jewels but needed arrowheads to move up the research track, it feels strange not to get anything for leftover tokens.

The game is designed around clever planning and resource management. You don't score for leftover tokens because the game rewards you for using your resources efficiently rather than hoarding them. Many games operate this way, emphasizing the importance of utilizing what you have instead of accumulating excess resources. If you find yourself with leftover tokens, it highlights the challenge of making the most of your opportunities throughout the game.

[artifact-pass-to-gain-as-last-player](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2820367/artifact-pass-to-gain-as-last-player)

> In a two-player game, if my opponent passes and I'm the last player, can I play an artifact that says "Gain 2 coins or Pass to Gain 3 coins"? Can I pay the cost and declare that I pass to gain the 3 coins?

Yes, you can play the artifact and then pass to gain the 3 coins. The rule states: "On your turn, you may pass to indicate you are done playing for the remainder of the round." Since you are the only player still taking actions, you are allowed to activate the artifact and then pass to end your turn. This is a valid action and helps to avoid the situation where the last player is stuck without options.

[solo-game](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2890984/solo-game)

> When your rival gets to do the "dig at a site" option, does he need the site to be discovered first?

Discover a new site" is a different rival action than "Dig at a site." If you draw a "Dig a site" tile, the rival digs at the proper site (if still available), but the rival does NOT discover a new site. So, yes, the rival only digs at already discovered sites.

> About the temple tiles, can the rival only have one 6-point tile, or can they accumulate more?

The rival takes a 6-point tile every time they get a research action and it is on the topmost row of the temple. "Each tile will be 6 points in end game scoring for the rival." In the solo game setup, there are 6 stacks of temple tiles, with 2 containing 6-point tiles. Each stack has as many tiles as there are players. So in a 2-player game, there are 4 available 6-point tiles. If one stack is empty, the rival takes from the other stack without needing the decision arrow.

This means it’s possible for the rival to take all 4 tiles, potentially gaining 24 points in end game scoring.

[the-discount-assistant](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2761974/the-discount-assistant)

> Can I buy an item card or artifact card with a discount that makes the price of coins or compasses zero?

Yes, you can buy an item or artifact card with a discount that makes the cost effectively zero. However, it's important to note that the discount provided by the assistant is only a one-time action, not a permanent one. When you use an assistant, it will become exhausted, meaning you won't be able to use it repeatedly for free purchases in the same round.

[can-i-use-main-action-research-to-refresh-assistan](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3319949/can-i-use-main-action-research-to-refresh-assistan)

> Can I use a main action research to refresh an assistant?

No, you cannot use a main action research to refresh an assistant. According to the rulebook Page 16, Using Assistants, 

"To use your assistant, turn it sideways, as shown. 
A sideways assistant is exhausted and not available for 
use. In general, you can use an assistant’s effect only once per round. At the end of the round, all assistants are refreshed – turned right way up again." (Rulebook page 16)

Specifically, when moving your notebook to a row with the gold assistant icon on the research board, you can upgrade one of your assistants to the gold level and refresh it, even if its silver effect was used earlier in the round. 

"However, certain card effects might refresh an assistant during the round, allowing it to be used again, perhaps even immediately" (Rulebook page 16).

[buying-an-artifact-and-then-using-the-travel-icon](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3323542/buying-an-artifact-and-then-using-the-travel-icon)

> After buying an Artifact you can resolve its effect immediately, ignoring the cost of paying a Tablet.
But I want to use the Plane icon. Is that possible?

No, you cannot use the Plane icon immediately after buying an artifact. When you purchase an artifact, you can resolve its effect right away, but this is considered part of your main action for the turn. As the rulebook states, "When you buy an artifact, you get to resolve its effect. That effect might be another action, like sending an archeologist to dig at a site. All this is considered to be part of your main action for the turn." (Rulebook Page 12)

This means that while you can resolve the artifact's effect immediately, the artifact is placed in your play area and cannot be used again until you draw it in a subsequent round. Therefore, you cannot use the artifact's travel icon until later when you have it in hand again.

No, the AI cannot gain more assistants once it has 2. The AI do not gain the assistants, just remove them from the game." While a human player can only gain 2 assistants, the AI can perform the action to remove assistants more than twice.

It also has "no assistant spaces on the AI board." The AI removes an assistant each time it researches with its research tile, but this does not apply when it researches with the "defeat a guardian" tile. It removes one assistant per round but does not gain new assistants.

[guardian-s-crown](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2558870/guardian-s-crown)

> Can the Guardian's Crown card move a guardian to an unoccupied tent site or level one site? Is it intentional for a guardian to be placed at a tent site?

 Yes, this is correct. The Guardian's Crown card intentionally allows you to move a guardian to any unoccupied tent or level 1 site. The card does not defeat the guardian; it simply chases it to another location, including tent sites. This design choice fits the game mechanics since basecamp sites can be dug for items, and a guardian can logically “protect” these sites, adding an element of challenge.

 >  If all other players pass, should I slide cards after my main action, or is it one long turn for me?

 Even when all other players have passed, your turn doesn’t become “one long turn.” Instead, you still have multiple turns, each consisting of a main action and any number of free actions.

 > Why can't I pick the better idol reward at a level two site?

 You do not get to pick the effect among the two idols at a level 2 site. During setup, you place two idols at each level 2 site, one face up and one face down. Notice this rule when using the Discover a Site action: "If the site has two idols, you take them both, but use only the effect of the face-up one" (Rulebook page 10). The advantage of discovering a level 2 site compared to a level 1 site is that you get an additional 3 points, but you still only get one idol effect, and you do not choose.

Yes. A guardian on a site never prevents you to dig on that site or to activate it. If you move your archaeologist to such a site, you gain the site reward, can overcome the guardian in a next turn or get a *fear* card if you do not before the end of the round."
The description of 'activate a site' is on the back of the rulebook:

"activate a site: When you activate a site, you use the site’s effect. You do not need an archaeologist there and other players’ archaeologists do not block you from activating the site, unless the card says otherwise. You do not pay any travel cost. You cannot activate a site that has not been discovered yet." (Rulebook page 24)

> Must you declare your Main Action before taking Free Actions? Can you take a free action, like "Draw a Card," then decide on your Main Action?

No, you don’t have to declare what you’re going to do. So first drawing cards is probably the best thing to do. In page 23 of the manual, it states:

"Free Actions: During your turn, you may perform any number of free actions before, during, or after your main action."

The rules do not specify you have to 'declare' your actions. Although it is always good to do so, because everyone can see and understand what you do and prevent mistakes. For example: If you declare you are going to buy an item, and you do not have enough coins, you still can play free actions first to gain them.

[getting-benefits-from-exile](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2843748/getting-benefits-from-exile)

> The rulebook states "exile this card to: When you play the card for its effect, it goes to exile instead of your play area." Does this mean that if you exile a card with exile benefits by other means different than playing it -i.e. a reward for climbing up on the research track- you will get no benefit because you have strictly to play the card for its effect?

Yes. If you exile the Airdrop from your play area by means of the research reward, you just exile the Airdrop card and do not gain benefits from the card effect. Exiling a card is the reward, and performing the exile in this way, it does never trigger the (exile) reward from the exiled card.

When you play Airdrop for its card effect, you place the Airdrop card on the exile stack, and gain an item from the card row directly into your hand.

When your opponent in a 2 player game has passed, you keep on taking turns until you pass. Same here with the Rival. If the Rival has taken their 10 turns, you keep on taking turns until you pass.

>  If you have a card like Sea Turtle with two ship movements, can you use one as a boot to put your archaeologist on a campsite and then use the other icon to put your other archaeologist on a level one ship site?

You cannot dig (or discover) at two sites in a single turn. You can play a double movement icon to send one worker to one site. That is your main action, and you do only one main action in a turn." The rulebook in page 9 reads:

"As your main action for your turn, you can send one of your archaeologists to dig at any of the 5 *tent* sites. You will also be able to dig at and **1** and **2** sites after they have been discovered."

This means using two archaeologists would require two separate dig actions, effectively counting as two unique main actions.

[coconut-flask-plus-discount-assistant](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2752572/coconut-flask-plus-discount-assistant)

> The rules state that movement points gained from assistants triggered by the Coconut Flask are (usually) lost unless they can somehow be used for a secondary action before the end of the turn. However, they do not state anything about triggering the Discount Assistant who counts as a main action. Can you combine the Coconut Flask and the Discount Assistant in a single turn to do two main actions?

Coconut Flask just activates the ability on an assistant. Thus, activating the discount assistant is the effect of your main action, the Coconut Flask. It's a legal move. This means you can legally use the Coconut Flask to activate the Discount Assistant without violating the rule of one main action per turn.

2. Pay the cost depicted at the bottom of the card.
3. Move the artifact to your play area. You have the

> Can I relocate an archaeologist that is at a site with a guardian using the Pathfinder sandals, and do I take a fear card?

Yes, you can relocate an archaeologist at a site with a guardian using the Pathfinder sandals. According to the rulebook on page 10, it reads:

"The guardian does not affect you immediately. However, at the end of the round you will gain a *Fear* card when you take your archaeologist back from a site that has a guardian on it. (See page 17.)"

"To avoid this, you may try to overcome the guardian as an action on a later turn. (See the facing page.) Or you might be able to escape the guardian with the help of certain cards that allow you to move your archaeologist or the guardian."

Therefore, you will not take a *fear* card immediately upon relocating, but you will if you return to that site at the end of the round.

[what-does-played-cards-accumulate-mean](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2974287/what-does-played-cards-accumulate-mean)

> The rulebook says that played cards stay in the play area during the whole round. Are they only to be used at the time they are played and paid for or can they be used multiple times during the round as long as they have been played? What does "played cards accumulate" mean?

Played cards accumulate" means that as you play more cards, they gather in your play area during the round. However, you can only use the effect of a card when it is played from your hand. Once played, the card stays in the play area but cannot be used again until the round ends and the cards are shuffled into the bottom of your deck. According to the rules, "played cards stay in the play area during the whole round" and do not get reshuffled to form a new draw deck if your deck becomes empty.

[idol-slot-effects-and-trading-coins-for-jewels-onc](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2576607/idol-slot-effects-and-trading-coins-for-jewels-onc)

> When activating the idol slot effect and trading coins for jewels, can you only trade one coin for one jewel or can you trade several this way during this idol slot activation?

You can only trade one coin for one jewel when activating the idol slot effect. This is similar to the limitation where you can only gain two tablets from one spot. If multiple coins could be traded for jewels in one action, it would create an imbalance in the game. Therefore, trading three coins for three jewels in a single activation would be considered overpowered.

[question-on-timing-of-free-actions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2627376/question-on-timing-of-free-actions)

> Can I use a free action to obtain tablets after advancing up the research track and before using the bonus tile effect?

Yes, you can use the free action to obtain tablets before the bonus tile goes into effect. According to the rulebook, Research, on page 14: 

4. Gain the results of your research:

"You are allowed to resolve the row’s effect before using the bonus tile if you want."

This means that you can draw a card, play it for the free action, and then resolve the bonus tile afterward. Each step in the main action can be treated as separate, allowing you to interject a free action between them, as confirmed under *Effects*, on page 24 of the rulebook:

"The lightening bolt icon denotes that the effect does not count as your main action for the turn. You can play as many free actions as you want before, after, and even during your main action."

[ancient-winecoconutflask](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2608087/ancient-winecoconutflask)

> If I use the Ancient Wine or Coconut Flask, which are main actions, can I activate an assistant whose effect is also a main action?

An assistant is an assistant, regardless of whether its effect is a free action or not. The rules state that using the Wine/Flask ability (thus using an assistant) is your main action.

> Can the effect of an assistant be used for any assistant in the three stacks, or only those on the tops of the stacks?

The card states: “Use the effect on the gold/silver side of one available assistant on the supply board.” The bottom example on page 15 of the rulebook explains: “Blue gets to choose one of the 3 assistants available on the supply board.” Furthermore, page 16 states: “When you move your notebook to a row with this (assistants) symbol, choose one of the assistants available on the supply board. (Usually, there are 3; however, some of the stacks might be empty later in the game.)” Note: Assistants not on top are kept hidden so that no one knows what they are until the assistant above them has been taken.

> If buying the Ancient Wine, can it be used immediately to copy a non-free action assistant for a discount on another artifact?

Yes, you can use it immediately. As explained on the backside of the rulebook Page 24, below Action Effects, it states: “You may immediately buy an artifact or item from the card row. The price is reduced by the amount indicated.”

> Can travel icons on available assistants be used to dig or discover a new site after playing Ancient Wine or Coconut Flask?

To dig or discover a new site, you need to perform a dig or discover action. Merely having a travel icon does not equate to having a dig or discover action. An assistant that gives you a travel icon is not the same as an assistant that gives you a dig/discover action.

[pending-use-of-idol-tiles-and-research-bonus-tiles](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659982/pending-use-of-idol-tiles-and-research-bonus-tiles)

> Can I save the effects of idol tiles and research bonus tiles for later use if I don't have the resources to use them immediately?

No, you cannot save the effects of these tiles for later. According to the rules, when you gain an idol or a research bonus tile, you must resolve its effect immediately. The rulebook states:

- Discovery Rules (Page 10): "Take the idol. Immediately resolve the idol's effect."
- Research Rules (Page 14): "If the space has a face-up research bonus tile, immediately gain the depicted bonus and remove the bonus tile from the game."

Thus, if you receive an idol or a bonus tile and you don't have the necessary resources to use the effect, you will lose the opportunity to utilize that effect. You cannot save it for a future turn.

[do-you-flip-level-ii-idols-for-the-bonus-upon-acqu](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2802284/do-you-flip-level-ii-idols-for-the-bonus-upon-acqu)

> There's a face up idol and a face down idol at each level II site. After exploring the site and getting the two idol tiles, does the face down one remain face down, or do we get the unknown bonus and then flip it face down?

No, you only receive the bonus from the face-up idol immediately. According to the rulebook, *To Discover a New Site* on Page 10:

"2. Take the idol. Immediately resolve the idol’s effect. If the site has two idols, you take them both, but use only the effect of the face-up one."

This means that after exploring a Level II site and obtaining both idols, you will only use the effect of the face-up idol and must resolve that effect immediately. The face-down idol remains face-down and does not provide any bonus at that moment. If you do not have the necessary resources to utilize the face-up idol's effect, that effect is forfeited.

[fight-the-monster](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3237502/fight-the-monster)

> When "fighting" a monster (or taming a guardian) can I exchange my transport cost (like 1 gold and 1 compass) for 3 gold instead?

Yes, you can exchange resources in that manner. According to the rules on page 9 under the section "Hiring a Pilot," you can always pay 2 gold to represent an airplane icon. This means if you need to pay a cost that includes an airplane icon, you can choose to pay 2 gold instead of using the necessary resource.

> The fourth step of the Research track seems to require the sale of an idol. Can I sell an idol that I have already fixed in a slot for bonus resources?

No, you cannot sell an idol that is fixed in a slot, as the rules for the Snake Temple explain:

"To advance a research token across this bridge, you must pay 1 idol. The idol must come from your supply crates – it can’t be one of those in a slot. Remove the idol tile from the game." (Rulebook Page 19)

> Can you buy more than one item or artifact from the card row in one turn?

No, you can only buy one card (item or artifact) per turn. Buying a card is considered your main action for that turn. As stated in the rulebook, you can perform only one main action per turn, which includes actions like buying a card, researching, or discovering a site. You can, however, buy additional cards during your subsequent turns in the same round.

> In solo mode, do the bot's location tiles give it any bonuses, like free items or card draws, when discovering or digging in those sites?

The only resource the bot gets from the sites are the idols (if it's discovering a new site); nothing else. The bot doesn't get any resources from the idols either.
